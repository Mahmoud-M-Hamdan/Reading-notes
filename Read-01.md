# What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
### Examples

1. One

3. Three

#### Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!
