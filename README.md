# Growth mindset
 The *growth mindset* can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.
### What is a growth mindset And what is the difference between it and fixed mindset?

A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.
By **contrast**, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.
### Reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset
1. Don't lose your focus
2. Always remember no pain, no gain
3. Try to always overcome obstacles and resist **"instant gratification monkey syndrome"**
